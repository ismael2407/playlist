i see a dreamer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXJGTnVfJic (CG5)

As the wind whips 'round
I take a breath for victory
Wanna play tag, or wave your white flag?
'Cause you'll never touch me
King of hearts, all in (all in)
It's not a sin to wanna win (sin to wanna win)
Can't see me flying like a bee, black and yellow energy
Only me on my team, naturally
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia, ow
I hear battalions sing of my demise
But I don't know the words (what?)
I take a road of my own making
On a journey, no returning
Whoa, whoa
That's how it goes
They've drawn the battle line
And I see fire in their eyes
Na na na na na na
I'm better off not listening, huh
Na na na na na na
I've got my own song to sing
We're flying like a bee, black and yellow energy
Only me on my team, naturally yeah
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
But I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia (phobia)
Ooh
My boat is full, why don't you swim?
Enjoy my fortress, I'll be right in
I stare a hole through danger's soul
We all know
I can do this, eyes closed
I refuse to fail
So heed this cautionary tale
You've got dragons, my little friend
You'll conquer them in the end
If you can, haha
I see a dreamer
Over there by the water
Oh, but I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
I see a dreamer
And he's ripe for the slaughter
Oh, but I got no, but I got no
Kakorrhaphiophobia
Phobia, phobia, phobia
Huh, huh
Phobia, phobia, phobia

man of the year:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YwppMLPoPg (Juice WRLD)

Cheers
Sippin' codeine like it's beer
I'm in London, so I'm screaming cheers
Man of the year, still got problems
Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful
Talkin' to myself, do it too often
JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome
I'm running up funds
Bottle full of pills, let's have fun
No cheap thrills, only rich ones
Fire drills, hotter than the sun
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through
They say life's a puzzle, all my pieces together
But from the way I'm movin' up
I'll prolly be piecing forever
I date a bad bitch, she'll be young and decent forever
Even with fake tits, these other hoes, she's decent forever
My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby
Well love, let's fuck her together
We got the world to our backs, give a fuck
Never have, middle fingers up, we screaming fuck 'em forever
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
My ups and downs
I'll jot them down
In London town
Cheers to the golden years
Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you
Let's raise our hands and sing and dance
I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through

cigarrettes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sis_JJZoAfQ (Juice WRLD)

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, oh, oh
Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest
I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her
Showing her that I love her, tryna show her a effort
Gotta keep it together-er
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh

She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
Oh, oh, this a love letter that I wrote
She keep me up when I'm feeling low
She's my overdose-dose-dose
Being heartbroken is so last year
Having breakdowns and she wiping my tears
I've been feeling fine ever since she been mine
In other words, yeah, she changed my life
Open up like a book, let her read me
One call away if she ever needs me
If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together
Treat me like a promise, baby, keep me forever
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S. baby girl, you're so gorgeous

I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
She picks my heart off of the floor
I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more
As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
I could talk about her all day
She's on my mind, always
As I find my way to the bottom of this bottle
She's in my head, please don't get me started
Thinking bout her all day
She's on my mind, always
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh
I'ma meet you back at the chorus
P.S baby girl, you're so gorgeous

sunflower:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApXoWvfEYVU (PostMalone)

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Needless to say, I keep her in check
She was a bad-bad, nevertheless (yeah)
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck (wreck)
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck (wreck)
Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check
She was all bad-bad, nevertheless
Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck
Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip
Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Every time I'm leavin' on you (ooh)
You don't make it easy, no (no, no)
Wish I could be there for you
Give me a reason to, oh (oh)
Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)
I know you're scared of the unknown ('known)
You don't wanna be alone (alone)
I know I always come and go (and go)
But it's out of my control
And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower (yeah)

Godzilla (Eminem)

Ugh, you're a monster
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, "The
Brain" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey)
In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the (ayy)
Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a
Monster
You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn, raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier
I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers
What goes around, comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack
Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink
Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretendin' to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her
Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Christian Rivera
'Cause my lyrics never sit well, so they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry
'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry
Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary
Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil
That means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people
Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in a lake
Obliteratin' everything, incineratin' and renegade 'em
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me
You don't want to be the enemy of the demon
Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl
I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a-, man, stop
Look what I'm plannin' (haha)

enemy (Imagine Dragons)

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us (huh)
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy (look, look, look, look)
(Look out for yourself)
Uh, look
Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy
Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint, no way
My enemy
Pray it away, I swear
I'll never be a saint

the search (NF)

"Hey, Nate, how's life?"
I don't know, it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (last night)
"I'm sorry", that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my car, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out)
I've been searchin'
"What does that mean, Nate?"
I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view like, this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (but hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
Been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid, I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean up my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (woo!)
I am developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident, dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me "Tone that down, " but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh

Ciudad magica (Tan bionica)

Intento seguirte pero no doy más
Sospecho que el tiempo se nos va a acabar
Estás algo loca y sos tan clásica
Dejá que la noche nos proponga más
Decime que sí, hacé como yo, a ver si sos tan genial
Persigo tus ojos por la capital
Me gusta que seas tan dramática
Tus ojos dibujan una eternidad
Y está muy bien así
Por hoy no pienses más
Yo sé que lo necesitás
Me quedo con vos, yo sigo de largo, voy a buscarte
Qué noche mágica ciudad de Buenos Aires
Se queman las horas, de esta manera nadie me espera
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así
Me quedo con vos, yo sigo de largo, voy a buscarte
Me mata cómo te movés por todas partes
Se queman las horas, de esta manera nadie me espera
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así
Algunos momentos de esta eternidad
Me son suficientes para recordar
Tus piernas bailando son tan mágicas
La noche se presta para mucho más
Y está muy bien así
Por hoy no pienses más
Yo sé que lo necesitás
Me quedo con vos, yo sigo de largo, voy a buscarte
Qué noche mágica ciudad de Buenos Aires
Se queman las horas, de esta manera nadie me espera
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así
Me quedo con vos, yo sigo de largo, voy a buscarte
Me mata cómo te movés por todas partes
Se queman las horas, de esta manera nadie me espera
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así
Qué noche mágica ciudad de Buenos Aires
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así
Me quedo con vos, yo sigo de largo, voy a buscarte
Me mata cómo te movés por todas partes.
Se queman las horas, de esta manera nadie me espera
Cómo me gusta verte caminar así.

vamonos a marte (Kevin Kaarl)

Desde el cielo todo es más bonito
Déjame llevarte a las estrellas otra vez
Como la noche de ayer
Vámonos a Marte donde nadie vaya a buscarte
Ni a ti, ni a mí
Donde todo es más callado y solitario pa' los dos
Donde no hay nadie más, que tú y yo
Dejemos la Tierra llena de gente tan mierda
Que nos quiere aplastar
Vámonos de viaje a las estrellas y a Marte
A olvidar nuestros problemas tan punzantes
Contemplemos las constelaciones
Y todas nuestras visiones que nos quitan el vacío
Que sentimos en la Tierra
Toma mi mano y vámonos de aquí
Ponte tu suéter gris y comencemos a huir
Vámonos a Marte donde nadie vaya a buscarte
Ni a ti, ni a mí
Donde todo es más callado y solitario pa' los dos
Donde no hay nadie más, que tú y yo

toda esta ciudad (Kevin Kaarl)

Odias todita esta ciudad
La gente te ha obligado a despedir
Días contados pa' escapar
Si lo haces, recuerda, estaré aquí
Y no es mucho
No soy tan distinto a los demás, mi niña
Pero si te vas, recuerda
Estaré aquí
Mm-mm
Te ha mentido toda esta ciudad
¿Qué han hecho? Si eres de admirar
Y mis brazos son para cuidar
Mi amor
Estaré aquí
Siente mi alma, siempre fue pa' ti
Te amo más de lo que tú crees
Cuando arda toda esta ciudad
Ya fue
Y estaré aquí
Si te han visto
Le has robado el brillo a la luna y a Venus
Me has amado en guerra, dulzura
Llevas tu luz
Y no es mucho
No soy tan distinto a los demás, mi niña
Pero si te vas, recuerda
Estaré aquí
Mm-mm
Te ha mentido toda esta ciudad
¿Qué han hecho? Si eres de admirar
Y mis brazos son para cuidar
Mi amor
Estaré aquí
Siente mi alma, siempre fue pa' ti
Te amo más de lo que tú crees
Cuando arda toda esta ciudad
Ya fue
Yo estaré aquí
