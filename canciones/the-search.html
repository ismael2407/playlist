        <p>
            "Hey, Nate, how's life?" <br>
            I don't know, it's alright <br>
            I've been dealin' with some things like every human being <br>
            And really didn't sleep much last night (last night) <br>
            "I'm sorry", that's fine <br>
            I just think I need a little me time <br>
            I just think I need a little free time <br>
            Little break from the shows and the bus rides (bus rides), yeah <br>
            Last year I had a breakdown <br>
            Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud <br>
            Had to see a therapist, then I found out <br>
            Somethin' funny's goin' on up in my house <br>
            Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out <br>
            You know, pack my car, take a new route <br>
            Clean up my yard, get the noose out <br>
            Hang up my heart, let it air out (air out) <br>
            I've been searchin' <br>
            "What does that mean, Nate?" <br>
            I've been learning <br>
            Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin' my burdens <br>
            Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect <br>
            Lookin' at the view like, this concerns me <br>
            Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous <br>
            Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry <br>
            And things might hurt me <br>
            It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (but hey) <br>
            It's worth it, though <br>
            Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats <br>
            Been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam <br>
            Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code <br>
            Pretty vivid, I admit it, I'm in classic mode <br>
            Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone <br>
            Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes <br>
            I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?) <br>
            Been makin' a whole lot of changes <br>
            Wrote a song about that, you should play it <br>
            I get scared when I walk on these stages <br>
            I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah <br>
            That's when I start to get anxious <br>
            That's when my thoughts can be dangerous <br>
            That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred <br>
            Forget what I'm saying, and <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Where'd the beat go? <br>
            Oh, ain't that somethin'? <br>
            Drums came in, you ain't see that comin' <br>
            Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin' <br>
            Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach <br>
            Throw it back up like I don't want it <br>
            Wipe my face, clean up my vomit <br>
            OCD, tryna push my buttons <br>
            I said don't touch it, now y'all done it <br>
            I can be critical, never typical <br>
            Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal <br>
            Intimate, but never political, pretty visual <br>
            Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though <br>
            You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable <br>
            Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool <br>
            Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful <br>
            Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (videos, videos, videos) <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Yeah, the sales can rise <br>
            Doesn't mean much though when your health declines <br>
            See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside <br>
            That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies <br>
            Try to hold it underwater but it always survives <br>
            Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise <br>
            Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies <br>
            You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am <br>
            The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place <br>
            And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way <br>
            It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe <br>
            Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay? <br>
            Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face <br>
            Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great <br>
            You'll never be great, not because you're not, but the hate <br>
            Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (woo!) <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I am developin', take a look at the benefits <br>
            Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate <br>
            Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it <br>
            Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence <br>
            Pretty evident, dependable can never be tentative <br>
            I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine <br>
            Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip <br>
            Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (ah) <br>
            It's that time again <br>
            Better grab your balloons and invite your friends <br>
            Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in <br>
            Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big <br>
            On a road right now that I can't predict <br>
            Tell me "Tone that down, " but I can't resist <br>
            Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist <br>
            The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh <br>
