            Smoke cigarettes, cancer in the chest like cardiac arrest <br>
            I've been feeling stressed, tryna find ways to impress her <br>
            Showing her that I love her, tryna show her a effort <br>
            Gotta keep it together-er <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh <br>
            I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh <br>
            She picks my heart off of the floor <br>
            I'm addicted, yeah, I need me some more <br>
            I don't wan' be lonely no more, oh <br>

            Being heartbroken is so last year <br>
            Having breakdowns and she wiping my tears <br>
            I've been feeling fine ever since she been mine <br>
            In other words, yeah, she changed my life <br>
            Open up like a book, let her read me <br>
            One call away if she ever needs me <br>
            If I ever fall apart, I know she gon' keep me together <br>
            Treat me like a promise, baby, keep me forever <br>
        </p>
