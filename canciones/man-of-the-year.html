            Cheers <br>
            Sippin' codeine like it's beer <br>
            I'm in London, so I'm screaming cheers <br>

            Man of the year, still got problems <br>
            Lookin' in the mirror, you look awful <br>
            Talkin' to myself, do it too often <br>
            JK, Juice WRLD, you're so awesome <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm running up funds <br>
            Bottle full of pills, let's have fun <br>
            No cheap thrills, only rich ones <br>
            Fire drills, hotter than the sun <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            My ups and downs <br>
            I'll jot them down <br>
            In London town <br>
            Cheers to the golden years <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's raise our hands, let's sing and dance <br>
            I know my lyrics saved you, I know my lyrics saved you <br>
            Let's raise our hands and sing and dance <br>
            I know my lyrics saved you, I know I helped you break through <br>

            They say life's a puzzle, all my pieces together <br>
            But from the way I'm movin' up <br>
            I'll prolly be piecing forever <br>
            I date a bad bitch, she'll be young and decent forever <br>
            Even with fake tits, these other hoes, she's decent forever <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My lady said she saw a baddie in the hotel lobby <br>
            Well love, let's fuck her together <br>
            We got the world to our backs, give a fuck <br>
            Never have, middle fingers up, we screaming fuck 'em forever <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My ups and downs <br>
            I'll jot them down <br>
            In London town <br>
            Cheers to the golden years <br>
