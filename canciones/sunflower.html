            Wish I could be there for you
            Give me a reason to, oh (oh)
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time I'm walkin' out
            I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
            Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down
            Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh (now)

            You don't wanna be alone (alone)
            I know I always come and go (and go)
            But it's out of my control
