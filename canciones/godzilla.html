        <p>Ugh, you're a monster <br> </p>

        <p>I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla <br>
            Better hit the deck like the card dealer <br>
            My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party <br>
            A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby, "The <br>
            Brain" Heenan which is probably the same reason I wrestle with mania <br>
            Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up <br>
            Consider it to cross me a costly mistake <br>
            If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, Hydroxycut <br>
            Pass the Courvoisi' (hey, hey) <br></p>


        <p>
            In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate <br>
            Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (ayy) <br>
            This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A <br>
            Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames <br>
            They cannot tame or placate the (ayy) <br> </p>
        <p>Monster</p> <br>

        <p>
            You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah) <br>
            I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah) <br>
            When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers <br>
            I look like a villain outta those blockbusters <br>
            Godzilla, fire spitter, monster <br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet <br>
            Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster <br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet <br> ></p>



        <p>
            I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls <br>
            Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off <br>
            It's impossible to list 'em all <br>
            And in the midst of all this <br>
            I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball <br>
            Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow? <br>
            Risperdal, voices whisper <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn <br>
            This is just the song to go ballistic on <br>
            You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher <br>
            I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological <br>
            Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka <br>
            When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a <br></p>


        <p> Monster <br> </p>

        <p>
            You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (yeah) <br>
            I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (yeah) <br>
            When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers <br>
            I look like a villain outta those blockbusters <br>
            Godzilla, fire spitter, monster <br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet <br>
            Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster <br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you never gave a damn, raise your hand <br>
            'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans <br>
            I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is <br>
            The motherfuckin' finger (finger), prostate exam ('xam) <br>
            How can I have all these fans and perspire? <br>
            Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire <br>
            And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire <br>
            These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier <br>
            I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers <br>
        </p>


        <p>
            What goes around, comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw <br>
            'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack <br>
            Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink <br>
            Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy <br>
            'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (cheesecake) <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher <br>
            Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretendin' to care <br>
            But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her <br>
            Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez <br>
            Christian Rivera <br>
            'Cause my lyrics never sit well, so they wanna give me the chair <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry <br>
            'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry <br>
            Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary <br>
            Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious <br>
            It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column <br>
            We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem <br>
            Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster) <br>
        </p>


        <p>
            Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink <br>
            Evil half of the Bad Meets Evil <br>
            That means take a back seat <br>
            Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single <br>
            Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people <br>
            Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle <br>
            I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em <br>
            Other words, I Minute Maid 'em <br>
            I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage <br>
            I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade <br>
            I'm finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in a lake <br>
            Obliteratin' everything, incineratin' and renegade 'em <br>
            I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid <br>
            But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill <br>
            I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla <br>
            You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me <br>
            You don't want to be the enemy of the demon <br>
            Who went in me, and be on the receiving of me, what stupidity it'd be <br>
            Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter <br>
            When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck <br>
            Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me <br>
            A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me <br>
            I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable <br>
            You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable <br>
            I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm on the toilet bowl <br>
            I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full <br>
            I'm not afraid to pull a-, man, stop <br>
            Look what I'm plannin' (haha) <br>
        </p>
