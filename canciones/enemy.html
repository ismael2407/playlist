    <p>
    I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows <br> 
    For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground <br>
    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told <br>
    When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned <br>
    </p>
    

    <p>
    Tell you you're the greatest <br>
    But once you turn they hate us <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Oh, the misery <br>
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br>
    Spare the sympathy <br>
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br> 
     (Look out for yourself) <br>
    My enemy (look, look, look, look) <br>
    (Look out for yourself) <br>
    But I'm ready <br>
    </p>
   

    <p>
    Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall <br>
    And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called <br>
    I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time <br>
    When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Tell you you're the greatest <br>
    But once you turn they hate us (huh) <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Oh, the misery <br>
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br>
    Spare the sympathy <br>
    Everybody wants to be <br>
    My enemy (look, look, look, look) <br>
    (Look out for yourself) <br> 
    My enemy (look, look, look, look) <br>
    (Look out for yourself) <br>
    </p>


<p>
    Uh, look <br>
    Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me <br>
    I'm praying that somebody hope for me <br>
    I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be <br>
    P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions <br> 
    Ready to go whenever, just let me know <br>
    The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor <br>
    The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable <br>
    I'ma tell 'em hasta luego <br>
    They wanna plot on my trot to the top <br>
    I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut <br>
    I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe <br>
    And it matters more because I had it not <br> 
    Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition <br>
    Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic <br>
    Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking <br>
    Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic <br>
    Batter, batter up, who the baddest? <br>
    It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat <br>
</p>
   

<p>
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br>
    Spare the sympathy <br>
    Everybody wants to be <br>
    My enemy <br>
</p>
   <p>
    Oh, the misery <br>
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br>
    Spare the sympathy <br> 
    Everybody wants to be my enemy <br>
   </p>
    <p>
    Pray it away, I swear <br>
    I'll never be a saint, no way <br>
    My enemy <br>
    Pray it away, I swear <br>
    I'll never be a saint <br>

    </p>
