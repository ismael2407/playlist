    <p>
    As the wind whips 'round <br>
    I take a breath for victory <br>
    Wanna play tag, or wave your white flag? <br>
    'Cause you'll never touch me <br>
    </p>
<p>
    King of hearts, all in (all in) <br>
    It's not a sin to wanna win (sin to wanna win) <br>
    Can't see me flying like a bee, black and yellow energy <br>
    Only me on my team, naturally <br>
   </p>
   
   <p>
    I see a dreamer <br>
    Over there by the water <br>
    But I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br> 
    I see a dreamer <br>
    And he's ripe for the slaughter <br>
    But I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br>
    Phobia, phobia, phobia, ow <br>
   </p>
   
   <p>
    I hear battalions sing of my demise <br>
    But I don't know the words (what?) <br>
    I take a road of my own making <br>
    On a journey, no returning <br>
    Whoa, whoa <br>
    That's how it goes <br>
    They've drawn the battle line <br>
    And I see fire in their eyes <br>
   </p>
   <p>
    Na na na na na na <br>
    I'm better off not listening, huh <br>
    Na na na na na na <br>
    I've got my own song to sing <br>
    We're flying like a bee, black and yellow energy <br>
    Only me on my team, naturally yeah <br>
   </p>
    
    <p>
    I see a dreamer <br>
    Over there by the water <br>
    But I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br>
    I see a dreamer <br>
    And he's ripe for the slaughter <br>
    But I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br>
    Phobia, phobia, phobia (phobia) <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Ooh <br>
    My boat is full, why don't you swim? <br>
    Enjoy my fortress, I'll be right in <br>
    I stare a hole through danger's soul <br>
    We all know <br>
    I can do this, eyes closed <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I refuse to fail <br> 
    So heed this cautionary tale <br>
    You've got dragons, my little friend <br>
    You'll conquer them in the endb <br>
    If you can, haha <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I see a dreamer <br>
    Over there by the water <br>
    Oh, but I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br>
    I see a dreamer <br> 
    And he's ripe for the slaughter <br>
    Oh, but I got no, but I got no <br>
    Kakorrhaphiophobia <br>
    Phobia, phobia, phobia <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Huh, huh <br>
    Phobia, phobia, phobia <br>
    </p>
